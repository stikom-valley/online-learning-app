## Project structure

**Directory Structure**  
This is the directory structure of the Food App. Currently, we have 2 main folders inside the lib folder, ui and utils folder. It can be added depending on what we need on the projects, for example, the data or repository folder.

This is a brief explanation about the folder.
|Directory | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|lib/ | Application  core scripts |
|lib/ui | Application  UI screens/pages widgets and widgets |
|lib/ui/pages | All UI screens/pages widgets |
|lib/ui/widgets | All UI widgets |
|lib/utils | Application  styles  related scripts and Miscellaneous utility script |

## Project dependencies

We can use dependencies/packages from any source such as [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). This is a list of packages that currently we used on the project.
|Dependency |Description |

|[google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) | A Flutter package to use fonts from fonts.google.com |

## Application Routing
All apps will use routing for navigating to some screen or page. This is our routes on the project.
| **Route**                | **Key**                      | **Screen**                     | **Related screen**                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| examplePage                   | example_page                       | ExamplePage                   | Example Screen for displaying app color and app typography                                                                        |
| mainPage                | main_page                    | MainPage                | Main Page screen or we can call it home screen                                                                      |
## Utility
In this project, we try to organize all the base sources like color, routes, and typography as well as we can. So we can easily use them for any screen widgets or widgets we want. The developer should follow the below-mentioned instruction when developing a new widget or modifying any part of the Food App.

1.  **AppColors** (`lib/utils/app_color.dart`) **:-** This is the primary script/code that manages the application color scheme. Therefore, the developer should stick with the pre-defined color scheme. If there is a need to introduce a new color, it must be handled through this script. We can declare a new color in this file.

2.  **AppRouter** **:-** We can declare all the screens with each data for what we need on this file to make it easy to implement the navigation.

3.  **AppTypography :-** This is the primary script/code that manages the application typography. We used Poppins as a base font family. If there is a need to introduce a new font family or font size and color to easily use it, it must be handled through this script.

This the example page looks like:
